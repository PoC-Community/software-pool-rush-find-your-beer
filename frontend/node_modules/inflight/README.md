# node-touch

For all your node touching needs.

## Installing

```bash
npm install touch
```

## CLI Usage:

See `man touch`

This package exports a binary called `nodetouch` that works mostly
like the unix builtin `touch(1)`.

## API Usage:

```javascript
var touch = require("touch")
```

Gives you the following functions:

* `touch(filename, options, cb)`
* `touch.sync(filename, options)`
* `touch.ftouch(fd, options, cb)`
* `touch.ftouchSync(fd, options)`

All the `options` objects are optional.

All the async functions return a Promise.  If a callback function is
provided, then it's attached to the Promise.

## Options

* `force` like `touch -f` Boolean
* `time` like `touch -t <date>` Can be a Date object, or any parseable
  Date string, or epoch ms number.
* `atime` like `touch -a` Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.
* `mtime` like `touch -m` Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.
* `ref` like `touch -r <file>` Must be path to a file.
* `nocreate` like `touch -c` Boolean

If neither `atime` nor `mtime` are set, then both values are set.  If
one of them is set, then the other is not.

## cli

This package creates a `nodetouch` command line executable that works
very much like the unix builtin `touch(1)`

# inflight

Add callbacks to requests in flight to avoid async duplication

## USAGE

```javascript
var inflight = require('inflight')

// some request that does some stuff
function req(key, callback) {
  // key is any random string.  like a url or filename or whatever.
  //
  // will return either a falsey value, indicating that the
  // request for this key is already in flight, or a new callback
  // which when called will call all callbacks passed to inflightk
  // with the same key
  callback = inflight(key, callback)

  // If we got a falsey value back, then there's already a req going
  if (!callback) return

  // this is where you'd fetch the url or whatever
  // callback is also once()-ified, so it can safely be assigned
  // to multiple events etc.  First call wins.
  setTimeout(function() {
    callback(null, key)
  }, 100)
}

// only assigns a single setTimeout
// when it dings, all cbs get called
req('foo', cb1)
req('foo', cb2)
req('foo', cb3)
req('foo', cb4)
```
